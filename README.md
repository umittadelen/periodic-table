# Periodic Table

A lightweight, interactive periodic table website with a desktop `.exe` version for easy access!

## Features

- **Interactive Periodic Table**: View details of each element, including atomic number, weight, and other key information.
- **Theme Toggle**: Press the `Space` key to toggle between light and dark themes.
- **.exe Build**: The `.exe` version opens the website as a standalone window, making it accessible without a browser. I used pyinstaller to build the executable. (the python version is available)

## Installation and Usage

1. **Access via Web**: [Visit the Periodic Table Website](https://umittadelen.github.io/periodic-table/)

2. **Download the `.exe` Version**:
   - [Download the `.exe` file](https://github.com/umittadelen/periodic-table/raw/refs/heads/main/executable/periodic-table.exe?download=)
   - Run the `.exe` file to open the periodic table as a standalone window.

3. **Switch Themes**:
   - Simply press the (`Space`, `Right Click`) key while on the website or `.exe` version to toggle between themes.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: Main HTML file containing the structure of the periodic table.
- **elements.json**: A file that contains information of all 118 elements in the periodic table.
- **main.py**: Python code if you want to use it (the `.exe` file is the build of that file)

## Notes

- The `.exe` file is a lightweight wrapper that opens the website in a dedicated window.
- All data is sourced locally for fast loading times and offline support in the `.exe` version.
